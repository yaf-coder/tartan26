An estimated 60% of all 335 modern freshwater turtle and tortoise species are categorized either as Threatened or Extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).,1,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
There are 57 species of freshwater and terrestrial turtles in the U.S. which constitutes approximately 18% of the global turtle species.,1,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"Most (93%) of the traded specimens are in the families Testudinidae, Geoemydidae, Emydidae, and Trionychidae which comprises about 250 species and represents 75% of turtle diversity.",2,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"About 2 million wild individuals were traded over 20 years of monitoring, with 48 species (of 335 turtle species in total) belonging to 10 distinct families being regularly traded.",2,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
Thirty-one species of the U.S. freshwater turtles and tortoises are included in the CITES Appendices.,3,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
For those and other species the issuance of an Annual Master File for producers has alleviated the burden and cost of requesting a non-detriment finding and review for each shipment of turtles.,4,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
CITES turtles must be identified to species.,4,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"41.3% were Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina), 29.1% were Sliders (Trachemys spp.), 10.1% were Cooters (Pseudemys spp.), 9.3% were Map/Musk turtles (Graptemys spp./ Sternotherus spp.), and 5% were Softshells (Apalone spp.).",5,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"increased trade volumes were reported from the U.S. for Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina), Florida Softshell (Apalone ferox), and Spiny Softshell (A. spinifera)",5,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
Asian imports of U.S. Mud and Musk Turtles increased significantly creating a sudden demand for wild-caught turtles for export as well as to stock captive turtle farms.,5,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"The majority of exports of Chelydra and Apalone had declared source codes C, R or F, and were likely juveniles destined for the Chinese aquaculture industry.",5,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"Available estimates and calculations suggest generation times of about 10-12 years for Chicken Turtle (Deirochelys reticularia) (Buhlmann et al., 2008), at least 25 years for Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) (Steyermark et al., 2008), about 25-30 years for Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata) (Litzgus, 2006), and 36-47 years for Blanding’s Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) (Congdon et al., 2000).",6,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"Targeted exploitation of wild adult turtles, especially females, for human consumption and international trade, introduces a novel factor in turtle population dynamics and significantly reduces a population’s reproductive output.",6,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
Natural generation times (age at maturity+1/annual mortality rate) are known with certainty for few freshwater turtle and tortoise species and can vary across the species range.,6,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"Once depleted, a turtle population recovers very slowly, typically requiring several decades to recover, if at all.",6,Case_Study_U.S._Freshwater_Turtles_and_Tortoises_CITES_2020_FINAL.pdf
"In Connecticut, 12 different types of turtles can be found, but 4 of them are only found in the ocean.",1,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
"There are around 356 species of turtles, and they are broken up into 13 different families.",1,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
Turtles differ from tortoises because they live in the water and have sharper claws.,1,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
These are called marine turtles.,1,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
"The four turtles of special concern in Connecticut are the Spotted Turtle, the Wood Turtle, the Diamond-Backed Terrapin, and the Box Turtle.",3,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
"There are 4 sea turtles found in Connecticut waters, including the Atlantic Green Sea turtle, the Loggerhead Sea turtle, the Leatherback Sea turtle, and the Atlantic Ridley Sea turtle.",4,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
"What is the difference between a turtle and a tortoise? a. Turtles live in water and have claws, tortoises live on land and have nails.",5,Lets-Learn-About-Turtles.pdf
